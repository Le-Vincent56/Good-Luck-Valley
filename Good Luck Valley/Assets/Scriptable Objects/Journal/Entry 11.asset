  Title: It Happened Again
  Content: "It happened again. My horrible thoughts have been confirmed. Willowroot
    is desolate. Even in their absence, I can feel the spirits that once lived here.
    Their fear, their pain, their anguish. It saturates this village like a sopping
    wet blanket, covering every roof and dripping down every pane. But these windows
    do not sit empty like the ones in Leafgrove. Something occupies them. As I inspected
    further, my breath was stolen from my lungs. I saw a plant. One that I had never
    seen before. A beautiful lotus wrapped in a bouquet of piercing spines. It whispered
    to me; it\u2019s soft hiss ringing hollow in my ear. It echoed pain, it craved
    anger, and it wanted more. It drove me to my knees and wrapped my ankles tight
    in vines like shackles. Through my desperation, I understood. It was you! You
    stole the spirits from this world. You destroyed their homes, and cast my Valley
    in darkness. Its petals bloomed with my anguish. You are the plague in my world."
