  Title: I Walked Alone
  Content: I walked alone. It felt like an eternity had passed. When I created the
    Valley, I grew a great forest, bathed it in golden sunshine, and filled it with
    homes for the spirits to live in. That world is now gone. The image of Leafgrove,
    empty and broken, still haunts me. And not once have I seen the Valley so dark.
    I felt as if it would never be light again. That was when something magical happened.
