  Title: I Found Seiji
  Content: "I found Seiji. It wasn't difficult, I used to visit him all the time,
    but ever since I had a daughter, I have been spending most of my time in the
    mortal world. When I saw him, he said he was expecting me. Not the warm greeting
    I hoped for. His eyes said everything, bloodshot with worry. \u201CYou feel it
    too?\u201D He asked me. I tried to speak with him further, but he only reached
    for my hand and gave it a squeeze, before he stared me dead in the eyes and said,
    \u201Csomething has come.\u201D"
