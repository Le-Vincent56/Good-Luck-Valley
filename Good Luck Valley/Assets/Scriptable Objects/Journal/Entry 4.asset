  Title: I Feel Powerless
  Content: "I feel powerless. The flowers wilt at my feet, the very same flowers
    that I bloomed just days ago. The rocks crumble, the river runs dry, and the
    trees decay. I can sculpt this world into any form, cast light into the shadows,
    and create new life with my fingertips. Why then do I hesitate? Why now do I
    feel fear all around me in the place that has only brought me joy all my life?
    If I can't use this amazing magic to keep the spirits of this world safe, then
    what\u2019s the point? A Caretaker is nothing without the ones I am meant to
    care for."
