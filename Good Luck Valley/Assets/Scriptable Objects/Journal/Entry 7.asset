  Title: I Saw the Firefly Spirits
  Content: I saw the Firefly spirits. Out of hiding they came, their round bodies
    and little wings unmistakable. Relief washed through me as they floated over.
    It was not a graceful float, more of an adorable, pudgy bob that reminded me
    of how my daughter used to run. They looked so weak and their light so dim. I
    fed them spirit fruit and led them to their lamps, which were cold to the touch.
    Once home, their light was brilliant. It woke up the world and fought the darkness
    back. With their light, I continued my search for the rest of the spirits.
