  Title: Something Happened Today
  Content: Something happened today. In all my years of being Caretaker of the Spirit
    World, not once have I seen the spirits act so strangely. The village spirits
    of Leafgrove are always cooking in their homes or tending to their gardens, but
    when I arrived today, they were all gathered outside. The sight made me uneasy.
    It was as if they were preparing for something. But what? I have no idea. All
    I know is, I could feel fear in the air.
