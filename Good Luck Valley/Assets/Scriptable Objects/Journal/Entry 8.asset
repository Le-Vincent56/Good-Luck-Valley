  Title: I Must Find Seiji
  Content: "I must find Seiji. He\u2019ll know what caused the spirits to disappear.
    He knows everything about the Spirit World. He\u2019s been here since long before
    me, and watches over the spirits when I go back to the mortal world to be with
    my family. He must know what is going on. I will travel to every single one of
    his workshops scattered throughout the Valley until I find him. If that\u2019s
    what it takes, I will do it."
