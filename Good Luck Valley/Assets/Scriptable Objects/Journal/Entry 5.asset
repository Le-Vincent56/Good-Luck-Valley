  Title: I Visited Ogo at His Workshop
  Content: "I visited Ogo at his workshop. By some miracle he was still there, not
    vanished or hiding. He must have been down here a while working on his signposts
    and ladders for the other spirits, because when I told him about what was happening,
    he seemed just as confused as I was. Oh Ogo, you big, round, loveable rock golem.
    You\u2019ve been with me through it all, making sure the spirits never get lost
    or have trouble climbing through the forest. I don\u2019t know what I would do
    without you. You can\u2019t disappear. You just can\u2019t."
