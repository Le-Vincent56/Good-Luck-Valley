  Title: I Returned to Leafgrove
  Content: I returned to Leafgrove. The way the spirits were acting wasn't right
    with me. When I entered the small village, my worst fear had come true. Leafgrove
    was empty. Doors left open in a creaking silence, watering cans abandoned at
    the foot of thirsty gardens as if somebody meant to return but never did, and
    cold pots hung over sleeping coals. The streets loomed in front of me, desolate.
    The soft twinkling of the wind chimes was deafening in the lonely silence. Where
    have the spirits gone? I must find them.
