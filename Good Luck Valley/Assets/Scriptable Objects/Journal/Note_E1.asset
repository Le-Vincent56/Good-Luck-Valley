  Title: Hana Note
  Content: This is a Hana note entry. These have to be long and windy because they
    give some crazy story beats, if the player decides to read them, of course. I
    think Owen was thinking aronud 100 words (And that might not be exclusive to
    just the Hana notes). I honestly have no idea if I've even reached that word
    count yet, but I don't actually think so because I think one hundred words is
    a lot more words that I think it is. There just really isn't any limit to this
    anyways, this could go off the page for all I care. Just kidding, I'll add a
    scrollview eventually if necessary, but maybe I can save some processing power
    by keeping Owen limited by his self-imposed constraints.
