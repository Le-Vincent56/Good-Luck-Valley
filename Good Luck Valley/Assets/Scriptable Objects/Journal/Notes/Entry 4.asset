  - "After searching each of his workshops scattered throughout the Valley, I finally
    found him. It was as if he was waiting for me. \u201CYou feel it too?\u201D He
    asked, but the look he gave me said it all.  "

  - "I have the power to walk between realms at will. Going back was easy, it\u2019s

    was dying.  "
