  - 'The look Seiji gave me when I found him said enough. I did not need his words
    to know his fear. I did not even need to see him to realize what was wrong. '
  - 'All I needed to do was return to the mortal realm. Easy enough. Once back, everything
    revealed itself to me in spectacular horror. My body was dying. '
  - Not just the slow, nihilistic, view. I was really dying. Doctors caught it early,
    but not soon enough. This is what the spirits felt. This is what they were afraid
    of. Their Caretaker is dying.
