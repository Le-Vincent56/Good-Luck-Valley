  Title: December 8, 2002
  TotalContent:
  - Something happened in Leafgrove. In all my years of being Caretaker of the Spirit
    World. not once have I seen the spirit's behavior change. Until today.
  - The Forest Spirits always come bounding through the trees to greet me. But today
    I have not seen them. The Village spirits stay inside their stone homes, tending
    to their gardens. But when I arrived in Leafgrove, They were all gathered in
    the street.
  - The sight made me uneasy. It was as if they were preparing for something. But
    what? I have no idea.
