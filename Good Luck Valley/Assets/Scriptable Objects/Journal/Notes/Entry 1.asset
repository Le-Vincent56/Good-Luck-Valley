  TotalContent:
  - 'The Spirits are restless today. The Forest Spirits skitter, flap, and dash about
    the Trees with great excitement. Nothing new under the Moon, but their energy
    feels different. '
  - Same goes for the Village Spirits. They usually stay inside their stone homes,
    but today they have gathered in the street. For what, I wonder?
  - "Why are the Moi and Tutao, Village and Forest Spirits, moving with such irregular
    purpose? It\u2019s as if they are running from something. Or hiding."
