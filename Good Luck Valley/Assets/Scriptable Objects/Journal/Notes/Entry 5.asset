  TotalContent:
  - Not just the slow, nihilistic view that humans share. I was really dying. Doctores
    caught it early, but not early enough. This is what caused the vines. This is
    what the spirits felt months before. Their Caretaker is dying.
  - I have a wife, I have a daughter, and I have a World relying on me. I can't die,
    not now, not yet. Not without picking a new Caretaker. Not before I see my daughter
    grow up. Not without telling my wife I love her one last time.
  - "This darkness festers inside me. It grows larger, as I grow weaker with every
    passing day. Seiji must have a cure. With all that research, in all those papers,
    there has to be something. For now, my mortal form is too weak to be in. Every
    second I\u2019m human is a risk I disappear forever. I only have one choice.
    Run."
