  TotalContent:
  - My forest has taken over the Spirit World. But it cannot undo what past Caretakers
    have done. I still see hints of him wherever I go. Just beneath the surface.
  - "It is easy to forget all I\u2019ve done as Caretaker. Here, peace and stability
    is normalcy. I am only reminded of my responsibility when something goes terribly
    wrong. And something has. "
  - The spirits are afraid, that I know. But of what? I am unsure. I must find the
    cause, and soon. I must find Seiji.
