  TotalContent:
  - It happened again, only this time worse. I found Willowroot abandoned. The forest
    has gone quiet, the front doors to homes left open. In the whole Valley, nothing
    stirs.
  - A new plant has taken bloom in Willowroot. Not one of my making. A vine of sorts
    the likes of which I have never seen.
  - The spirits fear it, that I know. But where did it come from? I am unsure. I
    must find the cause of this vine, and soon. I must find Seiji. He will know what
    to do.
