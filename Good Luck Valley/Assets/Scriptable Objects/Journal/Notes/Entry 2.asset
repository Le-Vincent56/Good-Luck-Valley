  TotalContent:
  - The strange behavior only lasted a day, the cause still unknown. As Caretaker
    I have gotten used to things going over my head. I am still human after all.
    The only mortal in a world of magic.
  - I still remember my first day here. When everything scared me, and every step
    I took caused plants and trees to erupt from the ground around me. Now this entire
    world I have created, every tree, flower, and blade of grass.
  - The Caretaker before me taught me everything. He helped me hone my spirit power.
    I wonder, who will come after me?
