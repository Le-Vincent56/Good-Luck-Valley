  - Sometimes I take my Spirit Power for granted. As I walk through this forest in
    the Valley, I remember it was me who created it.
  - "Every tree, flower, blade of grass\u2014all of it, formed by my will and emotion.
    As Caretaker of the Spirit World, the land reflects who I am. And the power it
    gave me was the power to grow. "
  - I remember my first time here. Every step I took, plants erupted from the ground.
    I was young and terrified. Knowing nothing of this world. But he taught me. Now
    I only wonder one thing. Who is next?
