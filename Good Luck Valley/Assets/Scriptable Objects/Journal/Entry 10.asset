  Title: At That Moment I Understood
  Content: "At that moment I understood. Something had come to the Spirit World,
    something awful. I ran to Willowroot as fast as I could. I weaved through trees,
    branches, and boulders at great speed, as a horrible thought grew louder in my
    mind. What if Willowroot was abandoned? The joyous spirits gone, and the happiness
    that village once brought to this world is replaced by everlasting sorrow? I
    ran faster, as the thoughts grew louder. A slithering following me like a shadow,
    biting at my heels. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. But I know I need
    to get to Willowroot, and fast. "
