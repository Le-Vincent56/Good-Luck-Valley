  Title: I Began My Search at Once
  Content: 'I began my search at once. I looked all around Leafgrove for any trace
    of village spirits, but it was as if they disappeared into thin air. I continued
    around the surrounding forest, with no such luck. Even the homes on the village
    edge were empty. I looked within every cave and behind every tree, boulder and
    bush, desperate to find the ones that once called this place home. But as my
    search brought me deeper into the forest, my hope too began to disappear. '
