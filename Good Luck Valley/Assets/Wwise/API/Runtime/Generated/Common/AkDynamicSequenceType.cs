///  The AkDynamicSequenceType is specified when creating a new dynamic sequence.
///  In sample accurate mode, when a dynamic sequence item finishes playing and there is another item
///  pending in its playlist, the next sound will be stitched to the end of the ending sound. In this
///  mode, if there are one or more pending items in the playlist while the dynamic sequence is playing,
///  or if something is added to the playlist during the playback, the dynamic sequence
///  can remove the next item to be played from the playlist and prepare it for sample accurate playback before
///  the first sound is finished playing. This mechanism helps keep sounds sample accurate, but then
///  you might not be able to remove that next item from the playlist if required.
///  If your game requires the capability of removing the next to be played item from the
///  playlist at any time, then you should use the DynamicSequenceType_NormalTransition option  instead.
///  In this mode, you cannot ensure sample accuracy between sounds.
///  Note that a Stop or a Break will always prevent the next to be played sound from actually being played.
